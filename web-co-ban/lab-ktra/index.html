              Always up for a challenge, I have worked across a range of lean
              startups and larger companies. In my first role, I was the Lead
              Designer for the first New Zealand startup to attend Y Combinator
              - the largest startup accelerator in the world. From there, I
              worked my way up to Art Director and Team Lead at Appster where I
              oversaw the design of 30+ mobile and desktop apps. I then moved to
              video creation company - VideoMyJob - where I led UI and UX design
              of the website and app. In my most recent role, I was a Senior
              Product Designer at Linktree leading design for the activation
              team and Linktree's first ever mobile app.

              Outside of work, I enjoy collecting 90s vintage toys, playing
              guitar and spending time with my wife and our two cats - Neo and
              Scully.

              Sebastian is a guru at all things UX design, consistently
              producing intuitive, modern, and bold designs. He is a natural
              problem solver in the design space so everyone went to him if they
              were stuck on a feature or flow. He has an arsenal of design
              skills including animation and graphic design. Not to mention, Seb
              was a design team lead, which means he managed a full team of both
              onshore and offshore designs reviewing and providing feedback on
              all of their designs... Any business would be lucky to have him."
